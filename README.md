# ray-tracer
Ray tracer written in Rust by working through the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series](https://raytracing.github.io/). Currently I am on the second book in the series.

## Running
Install rustup, download the code, and build using `cargo build --release`. Then run navigate to the /target/release directory and run `ray_tracer.exe > image.ppm`, or run one of the examples using `cargo run --example`.
